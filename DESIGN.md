# Package organization
#### For the moment we organize the packages as follows:
A controller package for activities and a model package for classes.  
In the controller package we find the two activities:  
First of all, the MainActivity is where all our shopping lists appear, by clicking on a list you are redirected to the second activity, the ListViewActivity. Here we see the content of our list and we can interact with it (add/remove items etc...), it is also here that we can take a picture of a receipt.
