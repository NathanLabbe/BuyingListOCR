# Installation

You have two options to install the application:

 - First, you download the APK file of the application (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1myXAS06udcCQ1U8i9OePGioUV6cP9nrr?usp=sharing), transfer it to your phone and install it after allowing unknown sources in your android settings.
 If you can't install ScanTicket.apk, install app-debug.apk, which should solve the problems

 - The second, you use android studio to launch the application on your phone.
